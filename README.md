# SumOfMultiples
Sum of multiples up to 1000

On start, the program asks the user to provide several comma ceparated numbers. Then under the hood it calculates the multiples of all these numbers up to 1000
and sums them up together. The result is displayed on the end. Erors, as inappropriate characters are also handled by the program.
